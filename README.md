# 5e-Character-Generator

Allows for the generation of a character, made to be playable using Dungeons and Dragons, fifth edition.

Randomly chooses first and last names from US Census data; the user can choose whether they want a male name, a female name, or to have one chosen for them.

Rolls for character stats using one of several methods. Supports the standard array, rolling three six-sided die, and rolling four six-sided die and dropping the lowest.
The user can also choose to allow for rerolling any 1s rolled by the above dice-rolling methods, in order to allow for higher average stats.

Allows the user to choose a class (e.g. fighter, wizard, cleric, etc), and allocates the rolled stats appropraitely. 
For example, if the user chooses to play a wizard, their highest stat will go to Intelligence.
Also allows the user to pick a 'random' option where the program picks the class for them.

After all choices are made and all generation is done, the program prints out the character in the following fashion: 

You are [NAME], a [CLASS].

Your stats are: 

Strength: X

Dexterity: X

Constitution: X

Intelligence: X

Wisdom: X

Charisma: X
